Problem Statement:
Introduction: Understanding the characteristics and life cycle of stars has been something that astronomers have been doing for a long time, and it still continues. One of the characteristics of stars is their surface temperature, which is key to understanding the type of star we are looking at. Handy tools which can figure out certain properties of cosmic bodies, help people like theoretical astrophysics to model the observations are rare. The goal of this problem statement is to build one of such tools.

Given a minimum of 2 FITS files of the same star/cluster at different wavelengths/bands of observation, you are required to estimate the apparent surface temperature of significant stars in the image.

Task:
> Develop a web portal which can accept multiple FITS files of the same patch of sky at different wavelengths.
> The files may be then processed (on client or at backend) and the image should be displayed on the portal. The apparent temperature of the significant stars in the image should be shown on the portal on being hovered, on the star. Include a range of hovering for individual stars.
> The test files will be in Blue and Red bands of the optical range.
